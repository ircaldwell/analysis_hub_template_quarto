------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary/abstract

Add a summary/abstract for the content piece here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Context

Give some context to the piece. What is the main problem or question being addressed? Is there some local context you want to add?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Heading 2 (add as many of these as you need)

Add description of the section here.

To get the following code block choose Insert –\> Executable Cell –\> R.

```{r}
#| label: Add a label for the code block here
#| warning: false 

####  Load packages and libraries ####
## If this is the first time using mermaidr, install the package through "remotes"
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("data-mermaid/mermaidr")

library(mermaidr) #package to download data from datamermaid.org
```

The `warning: false` option suppresses any warnings in the output.

## Heading 3 

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
